### Rails Api

- generate api framework with `rails new project_name --api`
- [example of api scaffolding](./api_scaffold_example.rb)
- postman to test api responses
- namespacing allows you flexibility to update data in the future
 - in routes and controller
- make good responses that return statuses, error messages, etc
- structure your json data with serializers
- make sure to allow access to your app with Rack Cors
